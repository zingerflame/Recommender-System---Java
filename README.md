This code is able to take in a data set and user input for preferences to calculate and recommend similar objects that the user would like. Default data set used is a movies database and matrix dimensions need to be altered depending on data file size.

Loosely based off of code written for Recommender System in MATLAB for Machine Learning Course.
Other files are for running specific operations such as Gradient Descent and Data Processing Functions, as well as converting Matrix code into Java usable format.
